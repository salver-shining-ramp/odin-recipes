# odin-recipes
This is my repo for the Odin Project recipes project as part of the HTML Foundations course

<!--Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)-->

The current project is that I am going to build a basic HTML website that functions like a recipe book, or recipe website.

It will not be particularly pretty as I will not be incorporating any CSS (or Javascript) and so will be a in brutalism style.

However, I will revisit this project at a later date as part of the Odin Project Foundations course to style it up using CSS.

I am going to demonstrate within this project that I can use various elements and HTML styling, as well as links and images.

Wish me luck!
